        A city immersed in the glorious past of the Vijayanagara Empire dating back 
        to the period between 14th and 16th century, Hampi in Karnataka is another great place to visit for history buffs.
         Ruins of this ancient city with its number of strikingly beautiful monuments, temples and
          palaces still tell you the tales of grandeur and magnificence of the Vijayanagara rulers.
          A trip to this historic place in Karnataka is incomplete without being part of its annually 
          held musical extravaganza of Hampi Utsav. During the festival, one can enjoy live cultural 
          dance performances with the backdrop of the splendid ruins lit up with lights which makes 
          it an exceptional sight to behold.
