       <p style="font-size: 1000%;"> One of the most incredible places in India, Kashmir is known for its natural beauty and is thus, rightly called Heaven on Earth. 
        With its picturesque lakes, lush fruit orchards, verdant meadows, pines and deodars forests, all enclosed with mountains of Himalayan 
        and Pir-Panjal ranges â€“ Kashmir seems to have directly made its way right out from a postcard.
       The beautiful Kashmir Valley is home to many destinations ideal for nature lovers, 
       family vacationers, honeymooners, and even a group of friends. Along with great sightseeing opportunities, 
       it offers adventure activities like trekking, skiing, and river rafting, recreational activities like fishing & angling,
        and even spa & wellness. Shopaholics and food lovers can also have their share of enjoyment as Kashmir spoils them with many options.</p>
