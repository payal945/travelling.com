        Seated on the bank of holy River Ganga, Rishikesh in Uttarakhand is an unmissable destination in India.
         Also dubbed the Yoga Capital of the country, Rishikesh is primarily visited by either yoga aspirants 
         or those seeking a spiritual experience. Learning yoga in the ashrams of Rishikesh and in the evening
          watching the Ganga Aarti are two of the best experiences in the city. But that’s not 
          all that Rishikesh offers, there are many adventure activities inviting you for an experience 
          of a lifetime. Adventure lovers can indulge in activities like camping, 
        white water rafting, bungee jumping from India’s highest platform, and flying fox (Asia’s longest ride).
